# *JSForDummies2 - .js Examples for JS Macros
"JSForDummies2" - JavaScript Macro pack for "JS Macros" and "Meteor Client" 
["Out of the box" examples]

Very chaotic but plentyfull library of super simple methods and classes for dummies.
Everything from HUDs, Vanilla Mappings, to remote control, various events, methods & classes. - Everything JavaScript dummies might need.

Un-Refined version, straight out of my folder.
More-less usage & class macro library. [Treat it as DIY]
